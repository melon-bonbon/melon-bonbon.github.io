			<h1>> "what is coming out?"</h1>
			<h3>Coming out is a stage in your life, where you get to know yourself. It is about accepting who you are, what you like, and what you want to be in total image. When you learn to come out to yourself, it is then your decision to tell everyone. It's a journey that will take you into the boost of society and make them to accept who you are. -melon </h3>

		<div class="hay">
			<h1>>"why is coming out hard?"</h1>
			<h3>It is said that coming out is the hard part of being a queer. When you are a queer, people think of you indifferently because of how binary society has implanted stereotypes on our roles. These stereotypes include closet individuals. When you are a gay, people categorize you as an HIV spreader. When you are a lesbian, the hard-die Christian-dom will think of you as a subject to hell. -melon </h3>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div class="hey">
			<h1>>"how do gays come out in highly conservative country?"</h1>
			<h3>There's no way of coming out in a highly conservative country. People will subject you in theocratic judiciary. They will kill you. They will make you confess your sexual orientation a sin. In Arabic countries, gays caught in anal sex are then put into trials and death sentences. Meanwhile, those, who are lucky enough, escape the country. -melon </h3>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div class="hay">
			<h1>> "do I need to come out to everyone?"</h1>
			<h3>Comint out is not a need. Let them assume who you are or what you are. Let them think ill of you. But the truth relies in your mind and what they can know is controlled by you. You, only. Coming out to limited people is fine. Coming out only to your parents is fine. It's not a need to make everyone knowledgeable for who you are. -melon </h3>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div class="hey">
			<h1>> "why is accepting myself an important part of my life?"</h1>
			<h3>When you are locked by the stereotypes brought by the traditions and the society, you are not a freeman. Say, you are a gay. Due to peer pressure, you marry a woman and conceive children. Yet, is that really your wanting? Or, you just want it because it sounds acceptable? Many people will say LGBT realization will break the families of gay men, but loyalty and responsibility are two matters only controlled by humans.However, realizing the weakness of these traditions is important so that those gay fathers' children and so children will not experience the same fate of marrying without loving a total. -melon </h3>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div class="hay">
			<h1>> "why are we afraid of the truth about ourselves?"</h1>
			<h3>We fear to what extent we may become. When people see "gay" as an offensive term, closet children become traumatized of who they might become unacceptable in a society they become locked in. We hate to see disappointment from others. We hate to see disgust in their eyes upon seeing what we are. -melon</h3>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div class="hey">
			<h1>> "is homosexuality confusion?"</h1>
			<h3>Homosexuality is never a confusion. Before, gay men used to think that they confuse their lust with men, but the reality is that they are really attracted to those individuals. When you try to medicate a person with those alleged anti-gay vaccines or anti-gay eletrocution, nothing happens in those gay men. They are just who they are. You cannot change the chemicals of love in their brain, for they have been born that way. -melon</h3>
		</div>

		<br>

		<div class="hay">
			<h1>> "why coming out is an advantage?"</h1>
			<h3>Coming out is an advantage because you get to know those individuals who will hate you for sure. When you come out, people react, and those reactions are your signs of who to get near with and who to make borders to. I'm not saying that you should avoid those people, but at times like this, stay with those who can understand you and educate people who are still not into it. -melon</h3>
